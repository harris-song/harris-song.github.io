He is an undergraduate researcher at the **Structures-Computer Interaction Laboratory** at UCLA, advised by Prof. [M. Khalid Jawed](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/m-khalid-jawed/) and Postdoctoral Researcher [Tuan-Anh Vu](https://tuananh1007.github.io/). His current work focuses on multi-modal perception and 3D reconstruction, particularly involving thermal, NIR, and depth fusion for agricultural and robotic vision systems. 

Previously, he's contributed to control systems research advised by Prof. [Jenny Yu](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086802910) and MIT Lincoln Laboratory Engineer [Christopher Lai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cclai/) at the **BANSHEE UAV** project (in collaboration with Lockheed Martin), where he developed autonomous visual tracking for VTOL platforms using ArUco marker detection and derivative-based control. 

He has also held software engineering roles at Leidos, where he developed infrastructure tools for autonomous naval vessels, and at the Office of Naval Research, where I worked on real-time detection pipelines using RGB-D imaging and SLAM systems.
